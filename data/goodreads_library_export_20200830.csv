It was hard for me to get back into reading about faeries and magic at first, but once I got over my personal mental block, I enjoyed the story. It was interesting to me to see how the fantasy genre has evolved since I was a kid. I think contemporary young adult books are good to read occasionally because they are a reflection of the current cultural norms and values. There are many underpinned themes of cultural and personal differences and acceptance of those who are not like yourself... too many themes. I wanted the author to pick one and stick to it. It was difficult to get in to, however by halfway through enough interesting plot points were happening and it tended towards being more action-packed that I continued. It had the plot but not quite the character development and complexity that I wanted in a story like this. Really, it just made me want to read Harry Potter again... (so I did).",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I wish she had talked more about her educational experiences, how hard it must have been for her with no previous formal schooling, but that was not the main point of the story.<br/>In the enlightened conclusion, Tara describes two versions of herself: one as she was at 16, obedient to her family, and the other as she is now, independent and strong. She describes the moment she knew that the former was gone, shed like an old skin. “You could call this selfhood many things. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.”",,,1,,,0,,,,,

When viewed with a positive attitude, error represents a false view of reality, and therefore opportunity for growth and improvement. “To fuck up is to find adventure: it is in that spirit that this book is written.”<br/>Why is it that we have so much trouble accepting our own fallibility? This book explores that theme and more in finer detail than you’d ever think would be interesting. There are so many aspects of our lives in which we are wrong, and yet we can’t seem to understand that to err is human, let alone accept it. This aptly-named book teaches us not how to avoid making mistakes but how to keep an open mind and embrace our imperfections.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

That said, I think the information was a little disjointed, being more a list of facts than a story. Parts of it were better about this than others.

I loved every moment from her bizarre reporting experiences to her detailed descriptions of how it felt to not understand yourself. She is somehow able to objectively describe these deeply personal themes, piecing together the story from the memories of everyone involved, each incomplete because of PTSD from the experience.
