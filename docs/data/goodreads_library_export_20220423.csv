I loved every moment from her bizarre reporting experiences to her detailed descriptions of how it felt to not understand yourself. She is somehow able to objectively describe these deeply personal themes, piecing together the story from the memories of everyone involved, each incomplete because of PTSD from the experience. She opens up fully to the reader, exposing her deepest thoughts and emotions, and winning me over with her vulnerability. “I wouldn’t take that terrible experience back for anything in the world.

When viewed with a positive attitude, error represents a false view of reality, and therefore opportunity for growth and improvement. “To fuck up is to find adventure: it is in that spirit that this book is written.”<br/>Why is it that we have so much trouble accepting our own fallibility? This book explores that theme and more in finer detail than you’d ever think would be interesting. There are so many aspects of our lives in which we are wrong, and yet we can’t seem to understand that to err is human, let alone accept it. This aptly-named book teaches us not how to avoid making mistakes but how to keep an open mind and embrace our imperfections.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Tara Westover describes her experiences of bonding and estrangement with her family, relying on anecdotes to build the mountain west world that I’ve never seen but now feel like I understand better. She has a unique perspective of paying homage to this world in which she grew up, but has now decided to leave behind after having been exposed to the outside world and education. I wish she had talked more about her educational experiences, how hard it must have been for her with no previous formal schooling, but that was not the main point of the story.<br/>In the enlightened conclusion, Tara describes two versions of herself: one as she was at 16, obedient to her family, and the other as she is now, independent and strong. She describes the moment she knew that the former was gone, shed like an old skin. “You could call this selfhood many things. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.”",,,1,,,0,,,,,
